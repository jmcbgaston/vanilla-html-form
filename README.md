# Vanilla HTML Form

This simple project answers the question: "Can you build a form purely out of HTML?"

### The Result:

Sort of? [Live link]()

### Findings:

- The vanilla HTML Form tag takes in an action which can create an `http` request with either a `get` or a `post` request. The `action` property is a place where we can specify the endpoint to make that request
  - ie: `<form action="some-api" method="post"></form>`
  - In this project I opted for the [{JSON}Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
